      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2020</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/Data-Driven-Disaster-Response">Data Driven Disaster Response</a></strong>: Designed an interactive D3.js based dashboard for visualizing the social media data of a city to aid the disaster response during a natural disaster.
Categorized the social media messages into resource categories using statistical metrics and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and applied rule-based sentiment analysis using NLTK. 
Developed a set of interconnected visualizations including - line-charts, pie-charts, heat-maps, etc. to view the frequency of a resource need or a particular emotion in any part of the city during any time.
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/Meal-Detection-using-CGM-data">Meal Detection using CGM data</a></strong>: Trained a Random Forest model on Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) time-series sensor data to automatically classify when a diabetic patient eats a meal, achieving an accuracy of 94%.

Programmed in Python and utilized PyTorch, transformers, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Model Integration with Mixture-of-Experts</strong>: Researched and studied various methods for integrating machine learning models together based on their similarity.
Programmed a proof-of-concept machine learning model which could integrate three separate Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) (the experts) trained to classify different classes within the MNIST dataset, to showcase the feasibility of a dynamic machine learning system which can be expanded or contracted based on the use case.
