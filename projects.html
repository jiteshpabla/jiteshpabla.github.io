    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>2019</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/clinical_semantic_text_similarity">Semantic Text Similarity (STS) on Biomedical text</a></strong>: Preprocessed the clinical text to remove stop words, punctuation etc. and utilized various word2vec pre-trained models to extract token embeddings in order to create a single vector representation for each sentence.
Fine-tuned multiple Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on the given STS dataset and extracted vector representation for each sentence.
Engineered several similarity features based on the extracted sentence vectors and applied gradient boosting regression to achieve a Pearson correlation greater than 0.84 between the ground truth and the model’s predictions.
</li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/face-generation-using-text">Text-to-face generation</a></strong>: Investigated and summarized various methods for facial image generation using text description of a face. Collected a dataset of text
        descriptions of hundreds of images from Labelled Faces in the Wild dataset and utilized word2vec to create text embeddings. Programmed a Keras implementation of StackGAN (a variation of Generative Adversarial Networks) and trained it to generate
        facial images using the collected dataset.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2018</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/crop_yield_prediction">Crop yield prediction based on temperature and rainfall for India</a></strong>: Predicted the temperature and rainfall for a set of Indian districts using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and it’s variation Long short-term memory (LSTM) and selected the method with the least mean absolute error.
      Utilized the rainfall and temperature prediction to further predict the yield of various crops in Indian districts using different methods - Linear regression, Random Forests, K- nearest neighbours (KNN) and a Feed-Forward Network; performed a comparative analysis for all the methods with Random Forests giving the least error.
      Used Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Keras and Matplotlib on Jupyter notebook for implementation.
      </li>

      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/secure-soldier-monitoring">Secure Soldier Monitoring System</a></strong>: Built a compact health and location monitoring system for soldiers in a battlefield using Raspberry Pi, Arduino and sensors
        to capture body temperature, heart-rate and GPS coordinates, along with a panic button and LCD to display messages. Re-engineered a blockchain prototype in Python to store AES encrypted data being transmitted from the monitoring system via GSM
        in an immutable and trustworthy fashion. Accepted to be published in 2019 International Conference on Signal Processing and Communication.
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks/tree/luarocks-api">LuaRocks API </a></strong>: Refactored the core functionalities of LuaRocks commands for - listing, uninstalling and showing details of packages, searching and installing rocks
        from the web, opening documentation, linting the rockspec, selecting a rock-tree etc., to modularize them. Programmed a complete Application programming interface (API) to provide access to LuaRocks functionality using object-oriented design principles.
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/luarocks/luarocks-gui">LuaRocks GUI</a></strong>: Designed a responsive and interactive web-based GUI using HTML, CSS, Bulma and Vue.js to give access to the LuaRocks functionality. Interfaced the GUI with the
        LuaRocks-API in the backend using CGILua.
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/basic-neural-net-compiler">Neural network compiler</a></strong>: Programmed a basic neural network compiler to define the layers, activation functions etc. Used Python Lex-Yacc and Keras.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>2017</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/PyDetection-and-BliStick">PyDetection and BliStick</a></strong>: Built a python library based on “OpenDetection” C++ library, for standardizing code written specifically for object detection. Developed
        an app called "BliStick" which uses the PyDetection library (served via a server) to aid visually challenged people to identify familiar/friendly faces and humanoid figures.
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/Image-Encryption-using-AES-and-Shuffing">2 level visual encryption</a></strong>: Built a python tool for basic encryption for an image. Encryption is done by converting an image to string format and
        applying AES and then applying a modified version (2,n)Share Encryption.
      </li>
      <li><strong><a href="https://github.com/jiteshpabla/anomaly-detection">Anomaly detection on Intel lab data</a></strong>: Applied simple moving average (SMA), Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) and LSTM to detect anomalous
        readings from various sensors in the dataset. Used Pandas, Numpy, scikit-learn, Keras and Matplotlib.
